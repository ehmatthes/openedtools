Traditional education uses time as a constant, and learning as a variable.  Competency education flips that: we treat learning as the constant, and time as the variable.  We set clear learning targets for each student, and then help each student meet their learning goals.  If a student needs 2 years to finish their high school goals, they graduate in 2 years.  If they need 6 years, they graduate in 6 years.

Many schools are currently working on implementing competency education.  The Nellie Mae Foundation recently published a study of 6 schools in New England focusing on competency education.  They found effective implementations, but every school has run into similar technical issues.
